<h2>Simplify(1)</h2>

<h3>NAME</h3>
<blockquote>
<b>Simplify</b> -- attempt to prove first-order formulas.
</blockquote>

<h3>SYNTAX</h3>
<blockquote>
<b>Simplify</b> [<i>-print</i>] [<i>-ax axfile</i>] [<i>-nosc</i>] [<i>-noprune</i>] [<i>-help</i>] [<i>-version</i>] [<i>file</i>]
</blockquote>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>

<b>Simplify</b> accepts a sequence of first order formulas as input,
  and attempts to prove each one.  <b>Simplify</b> does not implement a
  decision procedure for its inputs: it can sometimes fail to prove a
  valid formula.  But it is conservative in that it never claims that
  an invalid formula is valid.</p><p>

The <tt>PredSx</tt>
  interface in the <tt>prover</tt> package specifies the syntax used to
  specify the formulas; this syntax is based on S-expressions, with
  one S-expression per formula.  (I include this interface later in
  this man page.)  If the <i>file</i> argument is provided, S-expression
  formulas are read one at a time from the file, and proved;
  otherwise, <b>Simplify</b> enters a "read-prove-print" loop in which
  the user enters formulas interactively.  The input formula is not
  normally echoed, but it is when the <i>-print</i> argument is given.</p><p>

If <b>Simplify</b> can prove the formula, it prints <tt>valid</tt>.  If it
  cannot prove the formula, it normally prints a conjunction of
  literals that it believes to satisfy the negation of the formula.
  Computing this satisfying context takes some time, and sometimes one
  may be interested only in whether the input was valid or not; the
  <i>-nosc</i> options causes <b>Simplify</b> to simply output "valid" or
  "invalid".  The <i>-noprune</i> flag causes <b>Simplify</b> to skip the step
  of "pruning" any satisfying context resulting from a failed proof;
  instead, it prints the entire context.</p><p>

The <i>-version</i> option prints out the version number of the
  <b>Simplify</b> executable, and the <i>-help</i> option prints out a
  usage message.</p><p>

<b>Simplify</b> proves its formulas assuming some set of <i>axioms</i>.
  The first step in a <b>Simplify</b> execution is loading the axioms.
  You can customize the axiom set you use in two ways.  The <i>-ax</i> flag
  allows you to specify an alternate axiom set, and the the <tt>AXIOMDIR</tt>
  environment variable allows you to specify where <b>Simplify</b>
  should look for that axiom set.  <b>Simplify</b> comes with a
  collection of axiom sets included via the Modula-3 "bundle"
  facility; currently, these consist of "def.ax" and "esc.ax".
  (<b>Simplify</b> assumes axiom files use the ".ax" suffix.)
  If the <i>-ax</i> flag is not used, <b>Simplify</b> looks for "def.ax";
  if the argument <i>-ax file</i> is given, <b>Simplify</b> looks for
  "file.ax".  If the <tt>AXIOMDIR</tt> environment variable is set,
  <b>Simplify</b> looks for that file in the given directory, otherwise,
  it looks in its compiled-in bundle.  Axiom files use the same syntax
  as other input.</p><p>

The <tt>Prover</tt>
  interface describes (among other things) various environment
  variables that can be set to control heuristic parameters that can
  affect the performance of <b>Simplify</b>.
</p></blockquote>

<h3>FORMULA SYNTAX (PredSx)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>

This section reproduces the part of the <tt>PredSx</tt> interface that
  defines the syntax of formulas.
</p><pre>(* A "PredSx.T" satisfies the following grammar:

|  formula ::= "(" ( AND | OR )  { formula } ")" |
|              "(" NOT formula ")" |
|              "(" IMPLIES formula formula ")" |
|              "(" IFF formula formula ")" |
|              "(" FORALL "(" var* ")" formula ")" |
|              "(" EXISTS "(" var* ")" formula ")" |
|              "(" PROOF formula* ")" |
|              literal 
|
|  literal ::= "(" ( "EQ" | "NEQ" | "&lt;" | "&lt;=" | "&gt;" | "&gt;=" )
|              term term ")" |
               "(" "DISTINCT" term term+ ")" |
|               "TRUE" | "FALSE" | &lt;propVar&gt;
|
|  term    ::= var | integer | "(" func { term } ")"

"var"'s, "func"'s, and "propVar"'s (propositional variables) are
represented as "Atom.T"'s.

The formula

| (DISTINCT term1 ... termN)

represents a conjunction of distinctions between all pairs of terms in
the list.

The formula

| (PROOF form1 ... formN)

is sugar for

| (AND (IMPLIES form1 form2)
|      (IMPLIES (AND form1 form2) form3)
|      ...
|      (IMPLIES (AND form1 ... formN-1) formN))

"func"'s are uninterpreted, except for "+", "-", and "*", which
represent the obvious operations on integers.
*)
</pre>

<tt>&lt;func&gt;</tt>'s are uninterpreted, except for "+", "-", and "*", which
  represent the obvious operations on integers.<p>

In addition, the following forms control the environment in which
  theorems are proved.</p><p>

| (BG_PUSH pred)</p><p>

adds "pred" to the set of predicates assumed to be true, and</p><p>

| (BG_POP)</p><p>

removes the last predicate added to the set.</p><p>

| (LEMMA pred*)</p><p>

attempts to prove each predicate in the list, assuming all previous
  predicates.  If all proofs succeed, adds the last predicate in the
  list to the set of assumed predicates.
</p></blockquote>

<h3>DEFAULT AXIOMS</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>

The default axiom set used by simplify interprets function symbols
  defining array operations: <tt>select</tt>, <tt>store</tt>, <tt>subMap</tt>,
  <tt>storeSub</tt>, and <tt>mapFill</tt>:
</p><pre>|     (FORALL (a i x k)
|        (EQ (select (store a i x) i k) x))
| 
|     (FORALL (a i n)
|        (EQ (len (subMap a i n)) n))
| 	
|     (FORALL (a i n j k)
|        (EQ (select (subMap a i n) j k) (select a (+ i j) k)))
| 
|     (FORALL (a i x)
|        (EQ (len (store a i x)) (len a)))
| 
|     (FORALL (a i n b)
|        (EQ (len (storeSub a i n b)) (len a)))
|
|     (FORALL (v i)
|         ( EQ (select (mapFill v) i) v)
|
| #| non-unit RHS |#
| 
|     (FORALL (i j a x k)
|       (OR (EQ i j) (EQ (select (store a i x) j k) (select a j k))))
| 
|     (FORALL (j i a n b k)
|       (OR (AND (OR (&lt; j i) (&gt;= j (+ i n)))
|                (EQ (select (storeSub a i n b) j k) (select a j k)))
|           (AND (&gt;= j i)
|                (&lt; j (+ i n))
|                (EQ (select (storeSub a i n b) j k) (select b (- j i) k))))) 
*)
</pre>

The axiom set used for ESC/Modula-3 includes the axioms above.
</blockquote>

<h3>AXIOM SETS</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>

If you specify a customized axiom set, the axioms are S-expressions
  that are read from the file using the procedure:
</p><pre>    PROCEDURE AddAxioms(rd: Rd.T) RAISES { Error };
    (* "rd" must be a reader onto a sequence of syntactically correct
       axioms; if not, raises "Error".  The syntax for an axiom is:

    | axiom ::=   "(" ( UNIT | NONUNIT ) vars pat template ")"
    |           | "(" UNITLHS vars opSym pat template ")"

       "vars" is a list of atoms that represent {\it pattern variables} in the
       S-expressions "pat" and "template".  "opSym" is an atom.
       The "UNIT" or "UNITLHS" forms should be used to express a rule
       whose template is a literal (hence is a unit clause.)  The
       "UNITLHS" form should be used to gain some efficiency if the
       template is a relation between that matched enode and some other
       enode.  In the "NONUNIT" form, "pat" is a multipattern; that is, a
       list of patterns.

       An axiom corresponds to a "Match.MatchingRuleSet" "mrs" such that
       "mrs.unit" is "TRUE" for "UNIT" or "UNITLHS" axioms, and "FALSE"
       otherwise; "mrs.pats" is the singleton list containing "pat";
       "mrs.template" is "template", and "mrs.vars" is the array of atoms
       corresponding to "vars".  In a "UNITLHS", "mrs.opSym" is
       "opSym", in other axioms, it is "NIL".  (This means that the
       meaning of a "UNITLHS" axiom is "(opsym pat template)".

       All the axioms in "rd" are added to the global list of axioms.
    *)
</pre>

until the file is empty.  "pat"s and "template"s should follow the
  "PredSx" syntax given above.
